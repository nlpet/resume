        I am an experienced Software Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer specialising in NLP.
        Particularly interested in AI alignment problems and (mechanistic) interpretability research. I am motivated to
        bridge the gap between the capabilities of humans and AI agents, and am fully invested in working towards
        building a future in which machines and humans cooperate with and augment one another. I am driven by my
        curiosity to understand the inner workings of the brain and think that advances in AI will play an important role
        in providing valuable insights into this long-standing puzzle.

We developed a prototype for visualising the relationships between features as a directed graph and linked features to <a href="https://www.neuronpedia.org/">Neuronpedia</a> for further analysis. The code for the tool can be found in its <a href="https://github.com/nlpet/sae-feature-graph-vis">GitHub repository</a>.
